In this notebook,we will be using 3929 MRI brain scans and develop a model using Resnet,a Convolutional Neural network , a CNN model tod detect and localize brain tumors.
For this to work, we first perfrom image segmentation in which we try to extract information from images.We train the neural network to produce pixel wise mask of the image.
The 'mask' is the output produced by image segmentation at pixel level
Then we apply CNN models to extract high level general features and perform classification
To deal with the Vanishing gradient problem, we use ResNet ,which has a skip connection features enabling us to train many layers
ImageNet, which has 11 million images and 11000 categories is used to train ResNet network
For the ResUNet , we use a custom loss function known as focal_tversky from https://github.com/nabsabraham/focal-tversky-unet/blob/master/losses.py
We have achieved 97% accuracy after this process
